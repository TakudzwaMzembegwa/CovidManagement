# Covid Management System
The system consisted of:
### A mobile application: 
Used to scan a user's face to determine whether they should be given access to a building depending on whether they are wearing a mask.
### A desktop application: 
Responsible for monitoring whether a user was wearing a mask at all times while at their workstation.
### A web dashboard: 
used by an authority to monitor people in the building.
### A REST API: 
Used as a middle man between the 3 systems and a NoSQL database. The Rest API was hosted on Heroku (a cloud platform), allowing it to be accessible from anywhere.
